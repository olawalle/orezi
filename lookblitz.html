          Lookblitz is a web app that lets users book for beauty and fashion
          services, shop from items from said store and on another end it lets
          users (sellers) registe and create a store front where they can add
          services that they offer such as hair dressing, massages e.t.c, they
          can also put up products that they sell and can be shipped. This
          platform is an all in one for a business owner because it lets them
          create their own niche in a space where they can easily be found,
          upload pictures to showcase their works and aslo see what their
          competitors are doing. On the other hand, it lets users (shoppers)
          search for services based on location and this causes a ripple effect
          of time saving. It also lets users (shoppers) view reviews on the
          services rendered and compare prices, distance and comfort level at a
          glance.

          Using my personal user persona template, I created three different
          personas; with two being consumers (buyers or shoppers on the web app)
          and one being a service provider or seller. This helped to streamline
          the different flows that both users will experience, as they are both
          on the same app but having totally different experiencies.

          This was the first draft that was created, we had even gone ahead to
          create mockups, for both web and mobile before deciding that we wanted
          a change in the User interface for a better experience. Below are the
          UI’s for the first version. We went for the color pink as our primary
          color because we were trying to depict fashion and beauty but that
          didn’t turn out well.

          Final Version

        <p class="sect_text">
          After a lot of reviews and back and forth, we decided (I and the other
          designer) to start the user experience from scratch, this was
          excluding the user personas and maps because they worked. We really
          wanted the experience to be seamless, and we could already see where
          it was lacking in the designs we had created above. We also had a lot
          of concerns about how dominant the color (E0115F) was excessively
          used, it made it uncomfortable to use, admittedly we chose the color
          because we were more focused on sellers/service givers in the beauty
          and fashion industry.

        <p class="sect_text">
          Creating an application that has two users can become tedious but
          having good research and a team to work with makes it a lot easier. My
          major takeaway is that users are who we are designing for and keeping
          their goals and experience when designing is the most important part
          of the job.
