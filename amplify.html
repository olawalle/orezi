          Overview
        </p>
        <p class="sect_text">
          Amplified is a bible app that lets users read the bible both online
          and offline, it allows for multiple verses of different passages to be
          read at a go and users can add prayers to a verse. The app also has
          audio play; this lets users play prayers, verses or scriptures of
          their choosing. This app already existed in the google store and has a
          number of users. The main goal of this project was to redesign the
          existing app and take into consideration the pain points of users and
          create a better experience that is minimalistic and aesthetically
          pleasing.

        <p class="sect_text">
          My first step was to download the existing app and do a design
          qualitative analysis of the existing app, I also went through users
          comments and complaints, this helped me get a better understanding. I
          also did an interview with five of their users to gain better insight.
          From these above I was able to go further to create my user personas.

        <p class="sect_text">
          These were the existing screens, I decided that I was going to change
          most of it but maintain some parts of it such as rounded corners, the
          ux was totally off, therefore I had to create a new user map and
          personas.

                The onboarding screen has three options, to sign in for existing

                The option to skip is important especially for users who do not
                like to sign up, the screen after choosing to skip explains that
                choice and what it will mean for the user.

                down, this method was used because from the research carried
                out, users were familiar with this method.

          Conclusion
        </p>
        <p class="sect_text">
          Redesigning an existing app can be tricky because users are already
          used to a certain experience and in this situation we were not only
          adding new features but we were revamping the whole thing. The lesson
          here is that even if users are used to a certain experience they will
          want a better one especially if the familiar experience is a bad one.

          apple app store.
