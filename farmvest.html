          FarmInvest is a platform that connects farmers, investors and
          marketers. They are able to share their knowledge on the discussion
          threads, they can reach out to other, e.g a farmer can reach out to an
          investor and send him details about a farm or hectare he wants to
          cultivate.

          The Problem
        </p>
        <p class="sect_text">
          There are so many agrotech platforms where people can buy units of
          different farms like poultry or corn and wait a certain amount of time
          before collecting returns. But there has been a need for large scale
          investors who want to converse directly with the farmer or infact take
          a share in the business.

          My Role

          wireframing, visual design and prototyping

        <p class="sect_text">
          I started my research by carrying out a survey, then we streamlined
          answers and interviewed a few people. From the research it was
          discovered that this platform could offer more. We found that we could
          have a better experience if we we had the home page as some sort of
          feed/community, where users can raise discussions/topics and have
          answers or people message them privately. This change was because we
          found from the research that a large percentage of people also really
          wanted to be more aware of the agricultural world.

          Creating wireframes, I started with mobile and then I did a desktop
          and also a tab vie, the reason behind this was because of web
          accessibility, during our research we discovered that mobile phones
          were more used than others, hence why I started with it and adapted
          the others to follow.

          FarmInvest was an interesting product to work on, as it was my first
          time going into agriculture. What I learnt from this project is that,
          you should always focus on your user’s goals and this in turn will
          create good experience and answer the most important question of “what
          problem are you solving?”
