          Corporate organisations are looking for ways to reward their staf but

          This product was already existing, my first step was to carefully
          analyze the existing web app. In addition to market research, I
          conducted user research of 5 people. 3 of whom where Human Resource
          managers in companies already using suregifts business and 2 were not
          aware of the product. (HR managers because they are mostly perfom
          gifting duties in an organization). From the data we were able to
          determine the needs of users. Some interview questions were:

          Personas were created to not only help me understand our target

          realization that small factors like location, salary, and size of
          company can influence how those people make decisions, and in turn use
          our product.

            This voucher is just for one person, you can customize the template
            of the gift card by adding pictures (of recipient) and then adding a
            message, it’s mostly used for anniversaries such as birthdays or
            wedding anniversaries. The gift vouchers can be sent via email or
            printed and hand delivered.
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Group voucher
            </p>
            In this situation, multiple recipients can be added and sent
            vouchers at once, t’s mostly used during festive periods or to gift
            a particular department, team or level of staff. In this type of
            voucher only one merchant can be used at a time and only a
            particular amount can be sent. (e.g 500 vouchers of ₦30,000 cafe neo

            Vouchers such as phone line credits and internet subscription
            vouchers can be downloaded, printed and given to employees. They are
            good for gifting incentives immediately or spontaneously.

          Most bills payable in Nigeria can be made from this platform because

          more than one function with their wallet. This way they can track
          company spend on bills from the order history, hence budgeting is
          easier and cost is saved.
